              <p>
                It all started in 2018 when Mike noticed a problem: too many DFW homeowners were getting 
                overcharged for simple garage door repairs. The service was often impersonal and rushed, 
                with little understanding of North Texas climate challenges.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mike decided to do things differently. He built a company on three simple 
                principles: honest pricing, quality workmanship, and treating every customer like family. 
                This approach has worked across the DFW metroplex.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we're proud to serve 45+ cities across Dallas-Fort Worth. Our team has grown, 
                but our values haven't changed. We're still the same family-owned business that 
                puts your needs first, answers calls at 2 AM, and treats your home with respect.
              </p>
              <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900">
                That's the Mike's difference. That's why DFW trusts us.
