        {
          "question": "Why did my garage door spring break?",
          "answer": "Garage door springs have a finite lifespan measured in cycles (one open/close = one cycle). Standard springs are rated for 10,000 cycles (about 7-10 years for typical use). Springs break due to normal wear, metal fatigue, rust and corrosion, extreme temperature changes, or lack of lubrication. If your door is 7+ years old and has never had springs replaced, it's within expected lifespan."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I open my garage door with a broken spring?",
          "answer": "Never attempt to open a garage door with a broken spring manually or with the opener. The door becomes extremely heavy (150-400+ lbs) without spring assistance and can fall suddenly, causing injury or property damage. If your spring breaks with the door closed, leave it closed and call for service. If it's open when the spring breaks, don't close it, we can secure it in place during repair."
        },
        {
          "question": "Should I replace both springs even if only one broke?",
          "answer": "Yes, strongly recommended. When one spring breaks, the other has experienced the same cycles and stress and will likely break soon, often within weeks or months. Replacing both springs together saves you the inconvenience and cost of a second service call soon after. It also ensures balanced door operation since both springs are equally tensioned and new."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are high-cycle springs and are they worth it?",
          "answer": "High-cycle springs are rated for 25,000-30,000 cycles (compared to standard 10,000-cycle springs), lasting 2-3 times longer. They cost about 30-50% more but provide significantly better value over time. We recommend high-cycle springs for frequently-used doors (multiple family members, home businesses) or doors in hard-to-reach garages. For most homeowners, they're an excellent long-term investment."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does spring replacement take?",
          "answer": "For experienced professionals, typical spring replacement takes 1-2 hours including removal of old springs, installation of new springs, precise tension adjustment, balance testing, and safety checks. Unusual door configurations or additional issues discovered during service may extend this time. We'll provide an accurate estimate when we assess your specific situation."
